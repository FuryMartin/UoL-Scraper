Currys were smashing. Salads, especially the kale one - OMG! We both thought £25 per person is worth for what we got, even we didn't need the huge refill. The quality of the food, and the service is something we gladly paid for. Not to mention the feature BYOB, where you don't pay the fees, as oppose to other restaurants.This is the place we will go back to, and take our friends too. I can now understand why the week ahead they were already booked out and only a few slots were left for the day :)More"

The perennial question - would I go back - Definitely - organising to go back with a large group of friends !For the non vegetarian or non vegan - Restaurants like this will open minds to reducing the amount of meat people eat.More"

They were really apologetic about it...and said that if we wanted we could come and pick up some of the food they'd already prepared and have it as a take-away-  which is what we did.We arrived at Amrutha and were greeted by their lovely team, our food was ready and all boxed up within a few minutes. We offered to pay, but our offer was declined as  the experience wouldn't be the same... Amazing service!Although the experience may have been different, the food was still delicious. Yummy curries and fried vegetables with loads of different sauces all polished off with really tasty vegan brownies. Had such a positive experience and would 100% recommend for the food and the service. Need to go back now to experience it all in person.More"

Cocktails were being made one after the other so had to put...up with the cocktail shaker all through our meal. So if you want a quite table don't sit at the bar.More"
"2848","If you’re after a special/premium steakhouse experience, this probably isn’t the place to go…My partner & I were really looking forward to a special meal at a London steakhouse for our anniversary and we used a voucher with our booking (I think from Buy...A Gift). Upon arrival, we were greeted by who I presume was the manager and shown to the bar while we waited for our table to be ready. He then took us to our table and was so lovely and friendly, chatting about our day and what we’d been up to etc, which set a great precedent for the evening. Unfortunately, this was the only ‘good’ service of the evening as from then on it was very disappointing.Our waitress didn’t welcome us and wasn’t very friendly or attentive. We didn’t want any starters but I asked if it was possible to get some bread/butter to share before our mains and whilst she did accommodate this eventually, she walked off without saying anything (presumably to check this could be done as it was off-menu) which left us a bit dumbfounded. Upon ordering our mains, I asked for the duck leg with a side of broccoli. She spent about a minute or two on the e-tablet not saying anything, and then said ‘Duck and what side?’, to which I responded ‘broccoli please’. I’m not sure what took so long. My partner then ordered the 14oz Ribeye rare. She fiddled about on the tablet for a little while longer, then said how do you want it cooked even though he already said. She then said “are you sure you want it rare?” with a bit of a snootily tone. My partner responded yes and again she pushed and said not medium or medium rare? He said no, rare please, as he had already said twice by this point. I understand that certain cuts of steak come recommended a certain way, but the waitress didn’t seem to be asking for this reason, it felt that she was actually just judging his preferences. The food arrived and the steak was slightly overdone for rare, but my partner still enjoyed it - I don’t think it is worth the £44 price tag attached to it though and it was quite a fatty cut of meat. The portion sizes for the mains were fair, however the sides portions were not. The house fries were £6.50 for a very small pot - the same for the sauteed broccoli. Other than this, the food was really lovely. Especially the red cabbage that came with the duck - it was glazed in a really delicious sauce and for someone who doesn’t generally like cabbage, I ate every last bit of it! The duck meat almost fell off the bone it was so soft and tender. Really nice flavour. Just after our food arrived I asked the waitress for a martini cocktail. She responded by saying it would be better if I went to the bar myself and asked the bartender for the cocktail as “otherwise I would have to go, explain what you want and then come back” - is that not the role of a waitress, to take food and drink orders from customers? I decided not to get a cocktail out of principle in the end.We ordered one dessert to share (options for very limited). There were three options - sticky toffee pudding, apple pie, and a cheeseboard. I wish there were more dessert options, particularly a vegan option would’ve been nice as my partner is dairy intolerant and could only have a small bit of the sticky toffee pudding I ordered. The waitress was again a bit rude as we ordered this. My partner said he didn’t want a dessert but would have an extra spoon. She turned her nose up a bit, grabbed the menus from us and just walked off. No verbal confirmation that she heard him. The dessert itself was fine. It was a bit burnt on the bottom. Finally we then asked for the bill as our waitress walked past. She looked at me and made eye contact but again didn’t say anything or make any acknowledgement that she heard me, she just walked in the other direction. About 5-10 minutes later she brought the bill over, so obviously had heard us. Service charge is automatically added to your bill at 12.5%. I wish we had asked to remove ours as the service was poor, but I forgot. The whole experience also felt rushed. We were seated at 7.50 and had eaten our bread for starter and mains by 8.30 as they brought the mains before we had even had a chance to properly finish our bread. It was not a premium steakhouse experience and there are other London steakhouses at a similar price value (or even less!) that offer a much more premium service. If you are looking for a special occasion experience, I would probably look elsewhere. However if you’re after a quick/casual steak experience, this would probably be fine for you.More"
"2849","If you’re expecting the standard london steakhouse experience then don’t bother! Kindly gifted the voucher and was expecting big things with a celebrity chef’s name attached. Service truly shocking, time between courses embarrassing (had to get up after waiting an hour for main meal- only...for the wrong food to be delivered….) Got to the point where we were trying to look for an exit strategy without paying for anything and going somewhere else for food. Our waitress was awful from start to finish. When we arrived we asked for the wine list. 10 minutes later she came to the table and asked if we wanted to see a wine list :/. When the wrongly cooked streak arrived she told us there was nothing she could do. When we spoke to a manager he was just as clueless! Positives. The wine was nice and sticky toffee pudding was decent. Cons: literally everything else Advice: spend £20-£40 more and get good service and food!More"
"2850","Utilising a belated Three Course Meal Voucher we went here for a Sunday Roast.My word, the cocktail that greeted us was lovely - I've made sure that I've logged the ingredients to recreate it at home. The staff took a while to take our...order but this aided us to soak in the atmosphere.The soup of the day was lovely - sweet potato and red onion, however, I was missing some bread with it?The roast was deliciously presented and tasted lovely. My roasts now won't compare'. It was enough food too.For pudding I had the crumble and my partner had the lemon pot, both were consumed fully.Will certainly recommend.More"
"2851","Had to ask the waitress for service after waiting 20 minutes. Food arrived before drinks. Food was cold. Felt ignored due to being an experience voucher.

"2852","It turned out to most fantastic day despite 50mph wind.The booking handled by LSH Co was for a visit to Shard View and Lunch at LSH. Despite the booking for both events being made for the same time, when I rang Shard View they...flatly refused to change but to rebook at new ticket. However, when I rang the LSH, they couldn't do enough to accommodate the changes to Shard. Had a great view at shard despite the 50mph wind which was experience on its own.Then for the excellent meal and fantastic service at the LSH which made a great day..My wife preferred more veg options for the veggies.More"
"2853","Visited for first time as part of a London break for myself and wife. Virgin Experience deal. I was earlier concerned by some negative reviews but I can simplify our opinion of our meal and the service in one word. Superb!!. The steak was done...medium/well done as requested by both myself and wife. I would honestly say that this was the best steak I have ever had. You will need to add side dishes (which are extra) as the steak will look very lonely by itself. Wife chose just the fries. I chose the fries and salad. We both chose the passion fruit for drinks (as part of deal). Lovely and refreshing and particularly attractive in their shallow glasses. We both chose apple pie and ice cream (again as part of deal). Lovely! The Virgin Experience deal cost for the meal was an extra £20 (side dishes) so we paid £65 total. We chose not to pay the 12.5% discretionary service charge but in hindsight the staff probably deserved it as very professional. However, I treated our lovely waitress to a tenner which brought a lovely smile. For £65 our meal in lovely surroundings was a bargain at London prices. Thank you Steakhouse for making part of our 3 day trip to London a very special occassion. John and Lynne. P.S. The restaurant is in a lovely area with a bustling pub nearby. Easy to walk past the restaurant (as I did) if not looking hard enough for it o.k. It justifies having a large sign outside or something to let future diners know where it is. p.s. I don't understand some of the negative reviews I came across earlier. Either diners don't know what a 'discretionary service charge' is or they are stupidly fussy and overly snobby eaters who don't recognise a quality meal along with quality service. I have only one negative and that some of the tables a little to close to one another. One chap was just a foot away from me. Apart from that a lovely experience.More"
