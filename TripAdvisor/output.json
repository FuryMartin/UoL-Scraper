        "Comment": "We bought a Living Social 3 Course Lunch with Cocktails, and after seeing some of the reviews we wondered if we had made a mistake,\n\n But no, we had a wonderful lunch starting with 2 very alcoholic Cocktails a Cranberry Blush and Whisky Mac, Starters...were a Beetroot a Goats Cheese Salad and very substantial Potted Duck with sourdough, delicious. Mains were Confit of Duck and Rump Steak with Extras of King Prawns and Panzanella Salad  both really good but we expected the Confit of Duck to be off the bone, but we did wait 35 minutes after starter plates had been removed before our mains were served. We known food is cooked to order but other covers who had arrived after us were served before us. We both had the Lemon Posset for dessert which was  to die for.\n\n Will we go again yes when we visit London from the North East and hopefully the service standards will have improved on our next visit.More"

        "Comment": "This was bought as a birthday present using a red letter day experience. \n\nI must add we hadn’t read any reviews before we visited, so we had no preconceived ideas of what we would get. Yes we had looked at the menu but it’s slightly...different if you have a voucher.\n\nThe staff were attentive although the restaurant wasn’t busy when we arrived.\n\nWe chose the Ham hock terrine, Duck Pate, rump steak one done blu, and my daughter stated that it had to be cooked this way and no more. I had one done medium. Dessert were Sticky toffee pudding and an apple crumble. Sides were fries and onion rings. We asked were the sides big enough to share , the waiter took a moment and said yes.\n\nWe decided we were going to share everything except the steaks meaning we could experience everything.\n\nJust remember that all you get on your plate is the steak and everything else you pay additionally. \n\nWe asked for tap water and was given it per glass, which must add extra work to their load. Just leave the bottle on the table.\n\nThe ham hock terrine was ok, not much flavour but the duck pate was absolutely delicious.\n\nThe steaks well what can I say a disappointment. The blu was more medium. Both steaks were tough. My medium was stringy and was flat and small, not juicy at all. The head waiter came over to remove a glass from the table as he was leaving my daughter mentioned her steak was over cooked and tough. To be fair he did change hers and offered to change mine. I was over mine by this time and didn’t want to wait any longer as I was hungry. Although I wish I had. My daughters second steak came and it was perfect. I tasted it and it was delicious and so tender. It showed me how tough mine actually was.\n\nThe chips are cut very thin and was crispy, too crispy on the old side. And the onion rings were all greasy batter and lacked onion in the middle. Sadly Wetherspoons steak and onion rings are far superior, that is so sad to write.\n\nThe side portions are tiny.\n\nThe desserts were the star of the meal. The sticky toffee pudding was absolutely amazing. Apple crumble was lovely.\n\nThe cocktails tasted like fruit juice although were pleasant.\n\nThe toilets are old, need a clean. It’s not nice to see the cleaning cloth and blue roll resting in the fake orchids. The toilets don’t fit in with the look of the restaurant or where the restaurant is positioned!! \n\nFor what we paid for the voucher it was ok, being in the centre of the city. If we had paid full we would have been very disappointed. It would have only got 2* at best.\n\nDid I feel that we were treated differently to those paying full, yes is the answer. I understand why they offer these vouchers but they need to have the grace not to let this effect the outcome of the experience.More"

Which is great value for money. For starters we had a prawn...cocktail. Which was delicious the bread that came with it was nice but I think it was a slice of wholemeal kingsmill. For mains I had the Duck which as AMAZING! And my sister had the sea bass. She was a very big fan. And we both had the apple crumble for dessert. It was amazing we wish there was more. I can’t remember the name of the cocktail we got but it was basically a pornstar martini. It was very yummy. Honestly a great experience especially for the price we payed. At the end all we had to pay was service charge! A very nice dinner, we will be retuning.More"

        "Comment": "Went for dinner tonight at the London Steakhouse Co as part of a Virgin experience voucher I bought over 2 years ago (pre covid). Honestly gutted with what I’d thought I’d paid for… \n\nWe arrived and all was fine, host was nice. Had high expectations!...We got sat right next to the waiter assembly point, which wasn’t ideal, especially when the restaurant was relatively quiet at that point. You felt like they were just watching your every move, it was weird. Anyway, free cocktails arrived and they were rubbish - nothing more than 2 glasses of juice! Menus are deceiving too, the voucher basically allows for a very limited experience (a waste of time considering you’re already £50 down at the start). We scanned the extensive wine list and there were barely any available. Ordered a bottle of red in the end, it was poured for us initially, but as soon as one of us was halfway down the glass, the waiter would rush over and pour us more, dripping it everywhere in the process? Everything just felt so rushed, we would have been more than happy to pour ourselves to save him the stress!\n\nWe asked for table water assuming it would just be tap - the waiter brought us a bottle of still spring water, another £5 for the privilege. Starters were ok, but not hugely memorable. \n\nWhen it came to the mains, my boyfriend and I both went for rumps - I asked for rare and he asked for bleu. The waiter tried to tell my boyfriend that you’re not meant have rump bleu? Surely that’s just his opinion… we found it a tad rude. Anyway, he compromised and went for as rare as possible as per the waiter’s recommendation. Our steaks arrived, mine was fine but my boyfriend’s was far smaller and definitely towards medium, when he clearly stated he wanted it as rare as possible. Safe to say he was not happy! He raised it with the waiter afterwards, who had clearly checked out at this point, he offered us a free coffee ? Not really an ideal solution. \n\nDesserts were probably the best bit. Sticky toffee pud and apple crumble, but neither of us are really dessert people, we just had them since they were part of the voucher. If I had known about the ludicrous side situation for the main (if you don’t pay £6.50 extra per side you just get a piece of steak on its own?!) I would have traded the dessert in for a side. \n\nI could go on and on, I am so gutted about this. In the end we paid £115 including the pre paid voucher, for a seriously lacklustre meal and poor service. I am far too polite to ever remove a service charge, but the more I think about this shambles of an experience, the more I’m wishing I had. Don’t bother going here!More"
