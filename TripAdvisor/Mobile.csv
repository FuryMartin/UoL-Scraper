"6","Went to Alexander the Great with some friends after seeing the awesome trip advisor reviews, the place deserves placing the 6th best restaurant in London. Value for money is outrageous and the service is fantastic. We were served by Eileen who was great, always made...sure that everything was going perfectly and we were looked after. The food was amazing, had the mezze which was cooked over charcoal and you could tell.There is little more to say about Alexander the Great - if you want stellar value for money and a casual but friendly Greek restaurant look no further. Would definitely return again.More"

"9","The food was OK, although my moussaka was not very warm in the middle - still tasty, though. Disappointed that there was only a single red house wine by the glass - I'd have happily paid more for a decent wine but that was only...available by the bottle. I'd like to give this 3.5 rather than 3, but Trip Advisor only has average and very good, while this merits a good - it was certainly OK, but for the rating on Trip Advisor (6th best restaurant in London - which apparently makes it *the* best Greek restaurant in London) I would have expected something truly outstanding.More"

The food was delicious, beetroot salad/beef Bourguignon/kipper pate/sea bass and then we shared sticky toffee pudding!! The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable and...we would definitely go again!!More"
"3550","The service and food was dreadful I had purchased wowcher voucher to attend with my friends. I had Prawn cocktail and buttered piece of Hovis bread, I was expecting fresh baked roll!The waiter forgot to bring my fries to go with my steak so...here’s me eating chewy steak by itself, had to remind the waiter twice to bring my fries, later on I realised that she intentionally ignored me when I ordered the sides. I ordered rum punch and no way can I call what they served me Rum punch it was green!How rude the waitress was to my friend, my friend said she wanted fries as a side with her duck and waitress said no she can’t have fries that she already has mash with the duck!Then when I ordered desert for the 3 of us, she only put in an order for just 2 people and turned around and said I only ordered for 2 people what a lie, I now know she ignored me because this was the same thing she did when I ordered fries as a side and we had to remind her twice. We were looking forward to visit Marco Pierre restaurant, what a let down.More"
"3551","I was really worried after reading the reviews, especially as we had a voucher to use but was pleasantly surprised. We were warmly welcomed and shown to our table where the set menu was explained to us. We ordered our cocktails which were very nice...& part of our voucher deal. We were served by a friendly & attentive waitress. The food was lovely, the portions weren’t huge but were very tasty & we left the restaurant full. We wasn’t charged extra for sides, like lots of the reviews mentioned & my steak was very tender & tasty. My husband had a bottle of beer which wasn’t included in the voucher deal & our total bill for the beer and gratuity on the meal & beer (voucher value £55) was £14.00.More"
"3552","I’d read that many people were treated differently if they were attending with a voucher, but I didn’t find this to be the case. I think most of the people there were but it was lunch so perhaps different at night. I was treated really...well, sadly I was alone as my friend I was meeting, her train was cancelled, so she missed our slot. I had her champagne though and met her later  The staff were lovely, very attentive from afar which I like, the food was delicious, and the upgrade prices (if you choose to do that) were more than reasonable, I left very full and can still taste my steak. I upgraded to a rib-eye, had two sides, several drinks on top plus gratuity and it was only £40, my voucher included the apron too which I’ll wear when I next cook, not that I can cook . The place was packed so clearly popular, I thoroughly recommend…More"
"3553","Amazing steak, best I've eaten anywhere, waitress was great. We will definitely be back again. Everything was absolutely fantastic"
"3554","Excellent in all areas!! Going by previous reviews we were very sceptical about going with the virgin experience voucher but having said for us it was spot on!!! The service from the second we arrived was great the waiter was very attentive the whole time..., and the food was to die for! Yes there are extras like service change and sides but when your in London you expect to pay a service change and for excellent service you don’t mind ! We decided to just have the cocktail with the meal no extra drinks And had some bottles water which was around £5 . All in all the food was excellent and even though we used a voucher we didn’t feel like we’re treated any differently to anyone else . We would recommend sending any questions you have before your visit which will mean there is no confusion via email . They literally cannot be more helpful . We will be back for sure!!More"
"3555","Had the unfortunate  experience  of visiting  the London Steak House this evening we had paid £155 for a vip voucher when we arrived the menu included an extra £36.  for chateau  briand  which basically came up as a carved fillet steak had to pay extra...for a few French fries and a salad  total bill came to £200 which included a cheap bottle of plonk refused to pay service charge. and complaint  to Matrieu Dee on leaving who basically was.not interested we would have been better off going  to a weatherspoons where I doubt if we would have paid more than £50.00 Needless to say we will.not be going back plenty of other good value venues in the same area Terry Barnett .More"
"3556","The guy that seated us at the table was exceptionally rude when he  completely stuffed up explaining the menu after we told him who was dining on a gift experience and who was not! Manger made up for it after he saw our facial expressions...with free champagne but this original guy set the tone for me and therefore was less enjoyable. He should be sacked as we overhead another argument conversation with a patron when we entered the restaurant! Think he is South American or something?The chefs though are amazing as the food is extremely good so if they sort the service out - would recommend BUT careful if you going on a gift voucher as it’s “smoke and mirrors” and not transparent at all so for 3 people and two bottles of wine at £40 each - it still cost £145 with a £200 gift  voucher - like wow! So expensive  and I couldn’t quite understand their rationale (hence smoke and mirrors) so at the end of the day - great food, bad service and billing not transparent!More"

"5161","My friends and I booked the private room at MBER to celebrate a 30th Birthday. The room was lovely and intimate, it seated 5 of us comfortably and we had booked for 6 and think that would have been fine too. Our waitress was really...nice and friendly, very knowledgeable about the dishes and about the drinks. The food was fabulous; it’s served ‘tapas style’ so small plates and we just ordered about 3-4 dishes from each section (Meat, Fish, Veggie) and a few sides as well and we all just shared the dishes but were more than full and satisfied by the end. The food was very tasty and good quality. The service was very good and they went the extra mile to make the occasion feel special. Me and my group eat out a lot and at some very high end places and MBER is easily a contender and in many cases better than some of the more well known, high end pan asian restaurants in London. Would highly recommend.More"

Some dishes in our view weren’t even worth sharing between two, let alone one. Would highly recommend the sweet potato, swordfish and broccoli.More"

"5489","My friend and I were beyond impressed with our bottomless brunch experience at Scarlett Green. Can totally see how it got to be voted No. 1 brunch spot in the world! The food was extraordinarily good, pretty much every ingredient the best of its kind...I'd ever had. I had the Healthy Start and my friend had the Bondi. He said his was really well-balanced and loved the flavours. The staff were so kind and friendly, especially Stefan who was our main server. The staff kept checking to see if we needed more prosecco and were so prompt with our requests. Also, we were running six minutes late for our reservation (bottomless brunch being limited to 90 minutes) and they moved our reservation forward 15 minutes unprompted, enabling us to stay longer. Unrivalled food and service. My only grievance was that the acoustics weren't great and there was a lot of background noise in a small area. It made it really difficult to hear what staff were saying but otherwise everything was 10/10, mind-blowingly good. Thank you for giving us such a special experience!More"
