The food was extraordinarily good, pretty much every ingredient the best of its kind...I'd ever had. I had the Healthy Start and my friend had the Bondi. He said his was really well-balanced and loved the flavours. The staff were so kind and friendly, especially Stefan who was our main server. The staff kept checking to see if we needed more prosecco and were so prompt with our requests. Also, we were running six minutes late for our reservation (bottomless brunch being limited to 90 minutes) and they moved our reservation forward 15 minutes unprompted, enabling us to stay longer. Unrivalled food and service. My only grievance was that the acoustics weren't great and there was a lot of background noise in a small area. It made it really difficult to hear what staff were saying but otherwise everything was 10/10, mind-blowingly good. Thank you for giving us such a special experience!More"
