We were served by Eileen who was great, always made...sure that everything was going perfectly and we were looked after. The food was amazing, had the mezze which was cooked over charcoal and you could tell.\n\nThere is little more to say about Alexander the Great - if you want stellar value for money and a casual but friendly Greek restaurant look no further. Would definitely return again.More"

I'd like to give this 3.5 rather than 3, but Trip Advisor only has \"average\" and \"very good\", while this merits a \"good\" - it was certainly OK, but for the rating on Trip Advisor (6th best restaurant in London - which apparently makes it *the* best Greek restaurant in London) I would have expected something truly outstanding.More"
