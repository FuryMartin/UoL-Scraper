Having been away from Greece, I craved some home cooked Greek dishes, so I was really motivated to have a taste. As it turns out,...this taverna is a testament to authentic Greek cuisine, as if ordered and savored by the Acropolis or the sea! The service was as friendly as it could get. In other words, a real Greek experience!More"

Georgina was...an absolutely lovely hostess and Andy graced us with his presence, bestowing upon us some very strong shots of alcohol. Having just got back from a long weekend in Athens, we can confirm that this is as traditional as it gets, friendly service, amazing food and a warm atmosphere.
