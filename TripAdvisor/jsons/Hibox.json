There were Palestinian, Egyptian and Turkish tunes in the background which he was singing along to. \n\nHe...made us feel very welcome. Talked us through the food options. Chucked in some falafel for free into our salad boxes. And gave us a little box of baklava for good measure. Again, for free. \n\nThe food was delicious, the portions were large, I didn’t have food again until midnight. Quite possible the best falafel in London.More"

A very nicely prepared, healthy and filling meal - I didn't need anything else after this.
