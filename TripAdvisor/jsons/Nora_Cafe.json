We came here 3 mornings in a row for breakfast and it was excellent, sets you up for the...day ahead. It is always a good sign when the locals are eating somewhere and this had business people in suits as well as workmen eating here and staff from Greater Anglia railways too. I am Coeliac and they had gluten free bread but by day 2 they had been out and purchased gluten free sausages too. Thank you\nFood is great, staff are brilliant and very friendly, Cafe Nora deserves to do well, they work hard and care about the customers. Thank you, we will be back.More"
