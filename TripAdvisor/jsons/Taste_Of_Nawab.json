The tandoori dishes are a particular highlight for me. What really sets Taste of Nawab apart, though, is...the hospitality of its staff and in particular its owner. You would have to go a long way to find a warmer, more pleasant, more accommodating and more generous host. Go and have a meal there or order a takeaway, you won't regret it.More"
