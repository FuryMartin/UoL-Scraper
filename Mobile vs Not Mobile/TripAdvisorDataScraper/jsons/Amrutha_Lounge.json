One selection for both people fully feeds  2 people, and only one refill we needed- rice....We were full for hours afterwards.\n\nEverything was so delicious! Gazpacho was more like a desert. Currys were smashing. Salads, especially the kale one - OMG! \n\nWe both thought £25 per person is worth for what we got, even we didn't need the huge refill. The quality of the food, and the service is something we gladly paid for. Not to mention the feature BYOB, where you don't pay the fees, as oppose to other restaurants.\n\nThis is the place we will go back to, and take our friends too. I can now understand why the week ahead they were already booked out and only a few slots were left for the day :)More"

The Pakoras were my favourite, veggies done in a light crispy batter. What fantastic value for £25 each and we took our own wine. Service was perfect, the waitress was happy to answer all our questions about the food. Finished with a fabulous salted peanut butter vegan ice cream. Yes I intend to go back, do try this little gem of a place you will not be disappointed.More"

They were really apologetic about it...and said that if we wanted we could come and pick up some of the food they'd already prepared and have it as a take-away-  which is what we did.\n\nWe arrived at Amrutha and were greeted by their lovely team, our food was ready and all boxed up within a few minutes. We offered to pay, but our offer was declined as \" the experience wouldn't be the same\"... Amazing service!\n\nAlthough the experience may have been different, the food was still delicious. Yummy curries and fried vegetables with loads of different sauces all polished off with really tasty vegan brownies. Had such a positive experience and would 100% recommend for the food and the service. Need to go back now to experience it all in person.More"
