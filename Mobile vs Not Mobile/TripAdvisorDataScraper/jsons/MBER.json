This is a cozy place, nicely decorated and with very friendly staff.\nPortions are relatively small, because the concept is something similar to...\"tapas\": order a few different things, and share. If you need more, you just order more.\nCocktails were very good as well.\nThis is not a cheap place, but it is worth it. For two persons, including cocktails but not wine, we spent about 100 pounds.\nDefinitely a place to go if you want to indulge yourself...More"

        "Comment": "My friends and I booked the private room at MBER to celebrate a 30th Birthday. The room was lovely and intimate, it seated 5 of us comfortably and we had booked for 6 and think that would have been fine too. Our waitress was really...nice and friendly, very knowledgeable about the dishes and about the drinks. The food was fabulous; it’s served ‘tapas style’ so small plates and we just ordered about 3-4 dishes from each section (Meat, Fish, Veggie) and a few sides as well and we all just shared the dishes but were more than full and satisfied by the end. The food was very tasty and good quality. The service was very good and they went the extra mile to make the occasion feel special. Me and my group eat out a lot and at some very high end places and MBER is easily a contender and in many cases better than some of the more well known, high end pan asian restaurants in London. Would highly recommend.More"

The portions were tiny in my view, great for two people sharing. However we were a group of four so had to order...2 of each. Some dishes in our view weren’t even worth sharing between two, let alone one. Would highly recommend the sweet potato, swordfish and broccoli.More"
